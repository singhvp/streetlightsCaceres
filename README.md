# streetlightsCaceres

In this repo I pulled streetlights data of Caceres, Spain from European Data Portal to understand and interpret the data

In first attempt, I will try to only visualize data for better understanding. If there are any existing patterns then I'll deep dive to understand and explore. Ultimately I'd like to apply clustering on this data
